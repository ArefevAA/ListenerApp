<dc:description>One step could undo everything the Timekeepers hope to accomplish... Earth's ancient past, the future of the planet Kila, the Timekeepers universe of origin, the primordial era when the Nefilim first ruled the galaxy and a timeless universe of utter darkness, are all periods vital to advancing human consciousness. After surviving Ancient Zhou, the Timekeeper's efforts turn to rescuing the planet Kila from its ill-fated future. But a mishap in the remote mountains of Tibet before departure provides a nemesis with the perfect opportunity to launch a time-hopping vendetta against them. There is no where in this universe to hide. The discovery of a gate thought to lead to several universes provides more than just the means to undermine their stalker; it offers the chance to remember their lives as the Grigori, who once dwelt with the fallen Elohim, in the dark universe beyond the Eternity Gate.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The story of how I, Julian Carter, and my precious two-year old son, Stephen, left Atlanta Georgia and found ourselves on a white sailboat, tossed about like a cork on a raging sea off of Australia's northern tip in 1963, is harrowing. But it pales in comparison to what happened deep in the jungle where I was taken as a slave by a savage tribe unknown to the world. Some places dwell in darkness so deep that even God seems to stay away. There, my mind was torn in two by the gods of the earth. There, one life ended so another could begin. Some will say I was a fool for making the choices I made. But they would have done the same. They, too, would have embraced death if they knew what I knew, and saw through my eyes. My name is Julian and this is my story. But more, it is the story of my son who was born to change the world.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Love has a dangerous side in these compelling classics from New York Times bestselling author Jayne Ann Krentz. Stormy Challenge - Leya Brandon doesn't know what, if anything, to believe about Court Tremayne. He already lied about his name. And while she thinks her heart isn't at risk, she clearly underestimates his all-consuming desire to win her for his own. Little does she know that Court has no intention of stopping his pursuit, not until he leaves her hungering for the fulfillment only he can give. Reckless Passion - With his carefully groomed Southern manners, Yale Ransom might have stepped straight out of Gone with the Wind. But stockbroker Dara Bancroft senses a passion beneath the glossy surface of her prospective client, and recklessly, she offers him an unspoken challenge, never expecting that their conversation could explode into desire she's never felt before. But she pushes him too far, and now Yale wants to make her pay, straight from the heart.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Stone Barrington is back in the newest edge-of-your-seat adventure in the New York Times' bestselling series. Stone Barrington's newest client does not seem the type to bring mayhem in his wake. A polite, well-deported gentleman, he comes to Stone seeking legal expertise on an unusual - and potentially lucrative - dilemma. Stone points him in the right direction and sends him on his way, but it's soon clear Stone hasn't seen the end of the case. Several people are keenly interested in this gentleman's activities and how they may relate to a long-ago crime . . . and some of them will stop at nothing to find the information they desire. On a hunt that leads from Florida's tropical beaches to the posh vacation homes of the Northeast, Stone finds himself walking a tightrope between ambitious authorities and seedy lowlifes who all have the same prize in their sights. In this cutthroat contest of wills, it's winner-takes-all . . . and Stone will need every bit of his cunning and resourcefulness to be the last man standing.</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1665 England is facing war with the Dutch and the capital is awash with rumours of conspiracy and sedition. These are more frenetic than normal because of the recent sinking in the Thames of one of the largest ships in the navy - a disastrous tragedy that could very well have been caused by sabotage. As an experienced investigator, Thomas Chaloner knows that there are very few grains of truth in the shifting sands of the rumour-mill, but the loss of such an important warship and the murder of Paul Ferine, a Groom of the Robes, in a brothel favoured by the elite of the Palace of White Hall makes him scent a whiff of genuine treason. As well as investigating the murder, Chaloner is charged with tracking down the leaders of a fanatical sect known as the Fifth Monarchists. He suspects his masters are not particularly concerned by their amateur antics, and that the order for him to infiltrate the group is intended to distract him from uncovering some unsavoury facts about Ferine and his courtly associates. Then, as he comes to know more about the Fifth Monarchists and their meetings on High Holborn, he discovers a puzzling number of connections - to both Ferine's murder and those involved with the defence of the realm. Connections that he must disentangle before it is too late to save the country ...</dc:description>

As an experienced investigator, Thomas Chaloner knows that there are very few grains of truth in the shifting sands of the rumour-mill, but the loss of such an important warship and the murder of Paul Ferine, a Groom of the Robes, in a brothel favoured by the elite of the Palace of White Hall makes him scent a whiff of genuine treason. As well as investigating the murder, Chaloner is charged with tracking down the leaders of a fanatical sect known as the Fifth Monarchists. He suspects his masters are not particularly concerned by their amateur antics, and that the order for him to infiltrate the group is intended to distract him from uncovering some unsavoury facts about Ferine and his courtly associates. Then, as he comes to know more about the Fifth Monarchists and their meetings on High Holborn, he discovers a puzzling number of connections - to both Ferine's murder and those involved with the defence of the realm. Connections that he must disentangle before it is too late to save the country ...</dc:description>

<dc:description>Five Days in November, 1920: As the body of the Unknown Soldier makes its way home from the fields of Northern France, three women are dealing with loss in their own way: Hettie, who dances for sixpence a waltz at the Hammersmith Palais; Evelyn, who toils at a job in the pensions office, and Ada, a housewife who is beset by visions of her dead son. One day a young man comes to her door. He carries with him a wartime mystery that will bind these women together and will both mend and tear their hearts. A portrait of three intertwining lives caught at the fault line between empire and modernity, Wake captures the beginnings of a new era, and the day the mood of the nation changed for ever.</dc:description>

But she knows one thing for certain: she needs a job. About to graduate from a small college in upstate New York, her trust fund is going to run out. Her mother's dying wish: that Lana do something meaningful, that she uses her life to help people. Lana takes a job babysitting for a deeply troubled boy named Luke. Expelled from schools all over the country, and running circles around his beleaguered mother, Luke is accustomed to controlling the people in his life. He likes to play games. But, in Lana, he may have met his match. Or has Lana met hers? When Lana's closest friend Beck goes missing, Lana finds herself lying again - to friends, to the police, to herself. The story about where Lana was the night Beck disappeared doesn't match with eyewitness accounts. Lana is willing to do almost anything to keep the truth - about that night, about everything - from coming out. Even so, it might not be enough to keep her secrets dead and buried. Someone else knows all about Lana's lies. And they are dying to tell.</dc:description>

In the caravan one man stands out. His strength, self-imposed discipline and leadership mark him. He is an Outsider whose past is blanked from his memory. And his loyalty to the leadership is total. Searching for him in the limitless dunes are American and British experts in counter-terrorism with a full range of sophisticated electronics at hand. Hunting him from above is the unmanned Predator aircraft, invisible in the cloudless skies, carrying the Hellfire missiles. But he is no easy prey. If they fail to find and kill him, if he reaches his family and receives his orders, the Outsider will disappear again, before re-emerging in a teeming western city with a suitcase that will wreak mass murder when it is detonated.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Frank has been in a car accident. The doctor tells him he lost his spleen, but Frank believes he has lost more. He is missing memories - of those around him, of the history they share and of how he came to be in the crash. All he remembers is that he is a lawyer who specialises in small print. In the wake of the accident Frank begins to piece together his former life - and his former self. But the picture that emerges, of his marriage, his family and the career he has devoted years to, is not necessarily a pretty one. Could it be that the terms and conditions by which Frank has been living are not entirely in his favour? In the process of unravelling the knots into which his life has been tied, he learns that the devil really does live in the detail and that it's never too late to rewrite your own destiny.</dc:description>

Smooth, shrewd, and irreproachable, Marshall is a model chief executive, and the power he wields only enhances his charisma. And to maintain his position, he harbors secrets that could destroy his life at any moment. Both must face their own demons, and fight off those who are jealous of their success. Their lives as CEOs of major companies come at a high price. But just how high a price are they willing to pay? Who are they willing to sacrifice to stay on top? Those they love, or themselves?</dc:description>

<dc:description>Becky Jackson's family has been managing the hospital in far-flung Morgan's Reach for three generations. When Becky's husband is tragically lost at war, she and her young son Danny must leave the city and return to her birthplace to start over. But for all its charm, Morgan's Reach is a divided community, where blood is thicker than water and grudges run deep. So when a mysterious stranger appears outside the town and Danny begins to act strangely, it is not only Becky's newfound stability that's threatened. And what of the fact that there's not been a drop of rain in over three years? The risk of wildfire looms large and the hospital is already pushed to breaking point. A single spark could level the area in minutes - burning away everything for which the town has worked so hard; exposing the secrets they've fought to keep so close.</dc:description>

I know then that I'm not going anywhere...Sean is on the run. We don't know why and we don't know from whom, but we do know he's abandoned his battered, blood-stained car in the middle of an isolated, lonely part of rural France at the height of a sweltering summer. Desperate to avoid the police, he takes to the parched fields and country lanes only to be caught in the vicious jaws of a trap. Near unconscious from pain and loss of blood, he is freed and taken in by two women - daughters of the owner of a rundown local farm with its ramshackle barn, blighted vineyard and the brooding lake. And it's then that Sean's problems really start...Superbly written, Stone Bruises is a classic nail-shredder of a thriller that holds you from the beginning. The narrative slowly, inexorably tightens its grip as the story unfurls and will keep you guessing until the unnerving and shocking final twist...</dc:description>

She’s lost weight, loosened up and turned her talents to news reporting for one of America’s leading magazines.

When Rhydon unexpectedly re-enters her life, joining the magazine she works for as the new publisher, Sallie wonders if her former husband will even recognize her.

<dc:description>Still Life with Bread Crumbs begins with an imagined gunshot and ends with a new tin roof. Between the two is a wry and knowing portrait of Rebecca Winter, a photographer whose work made her an unlikely heroine for many women. Her career is now descendent, her bank balance shaky, and she has fled the city for the middle of nowhere. There, she discovers, in a tree stand with a roofer named Jim Bates, that what she sees through a camera lens is not all there is to life. Brilliantly written, powerfully observed, Still Life with Bread Crumbs is a deeply moving and often very funny story of love unexpected, and a stunningly crafted journey into the life of a woman, her heart, her mind, her days, as she discovers that life is a story with many levels, a story that is longer and more exciting than she ever imagined.</dc:description>

<dc:description>When Felix Brewer meets Bernadette “Bambi” Gottschalk at a Valentine’s Dance in 1959, he charms her with wild promises, some of which he actually keeps. Thanks to his lucrative, if not all legal, businesses, she and their three little girls live in luxury. But on the Fourth of July, 1976, Bambi’s comfortable world implodes when Felix, newly convicted and facing prison, mysteriously vanishes. Though Bambi has no idea where her husband, or his money, might be, she suspects one woman does: his mistress, Julie. When Julie disappears ten years to the day that Felix went on the lam, everyone assumes she’s left to join her old lover, until her remains are eventually found. Now, twenty-six years after Julie went missing, Roberto “Sandy” Sanchez, a retired Baltimore detective working cold cases for some extra cash, is investigating her murder. What he discovers is a tangled web stretching over three decades that connects five intriguing women. And at the center is the missing man Felix Brewer. Somewhere between the secrets and lies connecting past and present, Sandy will find the truth. And when he does, no one will ever be the same.</dc:description>

The smartphone is poised to take on a new role in medicine, no longer as a mere medical app but rather as a fully customizable personal physician capable of diagnosing and treating even better than the real thing. It is called iDoc. George's initial collision with this incredible innovation is devastating. He awakens one morning to find his fiancée dead in bed alongside him, not long after she participated in an iDoc beta test. Then several of his patients die after undergoing imaging procedures. All of them had been part of the same beta test. Is it possible that iDoc is being subverted by hackers - and that the US government is involved in a cover-up? Despite threats to both his career and his freedom, George relentlessly seeks the truth, knowing that if he's right, the consequences could be lethal. The New York Times-bestselling author returns with a top-notch fusion of ground-breaking medical science and edge-of-your-seat suspense.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It's devu, with a big twist. Three summers after the biggest man-made environmental disaster in history, millions of gallons of oil are again spewing from a hole in the ocean floor. But this rig explosion was in Cuban waters, just 50 miles away from Florida, and the situation is complex. The consortium doing the work is state-owned Venezuelan, Chinese and Russian, controlled by a mineral lease from the Cuban government. And the Cubans not only refuse assistance from the U.S., they also vow to fire on "hostile" American vessels that enter Cuban waters. Enter Jack Swyteck, who's honeymooning with his new wife Andie in the lower Keys. As an ominous black slick appears in the water, CIA agent Andie is called back to an undercover assignment. So Jack heads to Key West to see his buddy Theo Knight. There Jack is transformed from bystander to player in the unfolding oil catastrophe when he takes on a client whose husband was on the rig that blew up. She wants Jack to file a wrongful death in U.S. court. Taking on this unimaginably complicated case pitches Jack into a dangerous world, only to find that his case and Andie's assignment may be lethally connected.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Recently transferred to the London borough of Camden from Scotland Yard headquarters, Superintendent Duncan Kincaid and his new murder investigation team are called to a deadly bombing at historic St. Pancras Station. By fortunate coincidence, Melody Talbot, Gemma's trusted colleague, witnesses the explosion. The victim was taking part in an organized protest, yet the other group members swear the young man only meant to set off a smoke bomb. As Kincaid begins to gather the facts, he finds every piece of the puzzle yields an unexpected pattern, including the disappearance of a mysterious bystander. The bombing isn't the only mystery troubling Kincaid. He's still questioning the reasons behind his transfer, and when his former boss, who's been avoiding him, is attacked, those suspicions deepen. With the help of his former sergeant, Doug Cullen, Melody Talbot, and Gemma, Kincaid begins to untangle the truth. But what he discovers will leave him questioning his belief in the job that has shaped his life and his values, and remind him just how vulnerable his precious family is.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Rosemary's young, just at college, and she's decided not to tell anyone a thing about her family. So we're not going to tell you too much either: you'll have to find out for yourselves what it is that makes her unhappy family unlike any other. Rosemary is now an only child, but she used to have a sister the same age as her, and an older brother. Both are now gone - vanished from her life. There's something unique about Rosemary's sister, Fern. So now she's telling her story; a looping narrative that begins towards the end, and then goes back to the beginning. Twice. It's funny, clever, intimate, honest, analytical and swirling with ideas that will come back to bite you. We hope you enjoy it, and if, when you're telling a friend about it, you do decide to spill the beans about Fern - it's pretty hard to resist - don't worry.</dc:description>

<dc:description>They say a painting can have a life of its own. In the case of Ghosts in the Mind by Henry Sebastian Hubert, that's more than just an expression. This painting is reputed to come to life, and to bring death. The artist was a friend of Lord Byron and Mary Shelley, joining them in Switzerland during 1816, "the year without a summer." That was when they all explored themes of horror and depravity in their art. Now, almost two hundred years later, the painting appears in New Orleans. Wherever it goes, death seems to follow. Danielle Cafferty and Michael Quinn, occasional partners in solving crime, are quickly drawn into the case. They begin to make connections between that summer in Switzerland and this spring in Louisiana. Danni, the owner of an eccentric antiques shop, and Quinn, a private detective, have discovered that they have separate but complementary talents when it comes to investigating unusual situations. Trying to blend their personal relationship with the professional lives they've stumbled into, they learn how much they need each other. Especially as they confront this work of art, and evil. The people in the portrait might be dead, but something seems to wake them and free them to commit bloody crimes. Cafferty and Quinn must discover what that is. And they have to destroy it, before it destroys them.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Allison Weiss got her happy ending, a handsome husband, adorable daughter, a job she loves, and the big house in the suburbs. But while waiting in the pediatrician’s office, she opens a magazine to a quiz about addiction and starts to wonder. Is a Percocet at the end of the day really different from a glass of wine? Is it such a bad thing to pop a Vicodin after a brutal Jump &amp; Pump class, or if your husband ignores you? The pills help her manage the realities of her good-looking life: that her husband is distant, that her daughter is acting out, that her father’s Alzheimer’s is worsening and her mother is barely managing to cope. She tells herself that they let her make it through her days, but what if her increasing drug use, a habit that’s becoming expensive and hard to hide, is turning into her biggest problem of all?</dc:description>

<dc:description>The war everyone dreaded has begun at last, but for Susan Cahill it is more an adventure than a tragedy. Helped by a white lie about her marriage to Danny, she has a new job as a producer's assistant at the BBC, and glamorous new friends, including one American war reporter who has made London his base and Susan his target. Danny is also working for the BBC, sharing a room in a freezing farmhouse in Evesham, working long hours monitoring German radio broadcasts--and worrying about Susan. Stuck in London when the blitz begins, Susan's sister-in-law, Breda Hooper, faces up to the worst with a small son at home and a husband in the fire service. Then her Italian father, hiding out from both the authorities and his former partners in crime, prepares to leave Breda a legacy as explosive as any German bomb.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The incredible here and now /</dc:title>

<dc:type>text</dc:type>
<dc:language>eng</dc:language>
<dc:description>Michael's older brother dies at the beginning of the summer he turns 15, but as its title suggests The Incredible Here and Now is a tale of wonder, not of tragedy. Presented as a series of vignettes, in the tradition of Sandra Cisneros Young Adult classic The House on Mango Street, it tells of Michael's coming of age in a year which brings him grief and romance; and of the place he lives in Western Sydney where those who don't know any better drive through the neighbourhood and lock their car doors, and those who do, flourish in its mix of cultures. Through his perceptions, the reader becomes familiar with Michael's community and its surroundings, the unsettled life of his family, the girl he meets at the local pool, the friends that gather in the McDonalds parking lot at night, the white Pontiac Trans Am that lights up his life like a magical talisman.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Ryunosuke Akutagawa (1892-1927) is one of Japan's foremost stylists - a modernist master whose short stories are marked by highly original imagery, cynicism, beauty and wild humour. "Rashomon" and "In a Bamboo Grove" inspired Kurosawa's magnificent film and depict a past in which morality is turned upside down, while tales such as "The Nose", "O-Gin" and "Loyalty" paint a rich and imaginative picture of a medieval Japan peopled by Shoguns and priests, vagrants and peasants. And in later works such as "Death Register", "The Life of a Stupid Man" and "Spinning Gears", Akutagawa drew from his own life to devastating effect, revealing his intense melancholy and terror of madness in exquisitely moving impressionistic stories.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Melding his native Irish sensibilities to those of his adopted west-coast Scotland, these tales attend to life's big events: love and loss, separation and violence, death and betrayal. But the stories teem with smaller significant moments too - private epiphanies, chilling exchanges, intimate encounters. A writer of great compassion, insight and humanity, MacLaverty surprises us time and again with the sensitivity of his ear, the accuracy of his eye. Each of these extraordinary stories - with their wry, self-deprecating humour, their elegance and subtle wisdom - gets to the very heart of life.</dc:description>

<dc:description>An anonymous letter sent to Larkwood's Prior accuses Peter Henderson, an academic celebrity renowned for daring ideas, of a grotesque murder: the calculated killing of Jenny, his disabled partner, believed by everyone to have died peacefully two years previously from a sudden attack of cancer. But for this letter there is no evidence, no suspect and no crime. Time has moved on. Lives have been rebuilt. Grief and loss are tempered by a comforting thought: a paralysed woman, once an acclaimed dancer, had died quickly and painlessly, spared a drawn out illness; a life marked by agonising misfortune had come to a merciful end. But now Anselm has been told the truth behind the soothing lie. He must move cautiously to expose the killer and the killing. He must think of young Timothy, Jenny and Peter's son. A boy who is still learning to live without his mother. And so Anselm begins his most delicate investigation yet, unaware that Jenny's adoring father is also thinking of Timothy's future; that this urbane former army officer is haunted by the memory of torture and shoot-to-kill operations in Northern Ireland; that he remains capable of anything, if he thinks it's for the best; that he has set out to execute Peter Henderson. Death, dying and killing, however, were never so complicated.</dc:description>

Joseph Heller's bestselling novel is a hilarious and tragic satire on military madness, and the tale of one man's efforts to survive it. 50th anniversary edition.</dc:description>

<dc:type>text</dc:type>
<dc:language>eng</dc:language>
<dc:description>Arrested for snorting cocaine off a car bonnet, award-winning author and quintessential dilettante Frederic Beigbeder reflects on his troubled childhood, while spending a night in police custody. Confined to a cell, Frederic Beigbeder's seeks escape in his childhood memories, only to discover he can recall just one. From this, he reconstructs both his past and that of his family; the glamour of Sixties Paris and his father's playboy life in New York, so distinct from the experiences of his soldier grandfather, whose lifespan Frederic has now exceeded. His arrest all over the tabloids, Frederic wonders if the time has come to grow up. 'A French Novel' is a belated coming-of-age tale, profoundly tender and charmingly ironic.</dc:description>

<dc:description>SEAL Team Six and Thomas Crocker are back hunting their most elusive adversary yet: The Falcon. HUNT THE FALCON finds SEAL Team Six chasing "The Falcon," an Iranian terrorist who has been stealing Libyan nuclear material. The hunt takes the team from Bangkok to Caracas in search of The Falcon's forces. Crocker convinces the powers that be to allow him to operate in Iran, and he and the team go in full black in order to take down their mark. Meanwhile, Crocker's estranged father--a former firefighter and hell-raiser who was kicked out of the Navy as a young seaman--reappears, forcing Crocker to recognize his life outside the shadows of SEAL life. It's not easy when work calls over 300 days of the year, and when it's this essential to take an enemy down.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Sarah Zuckerman is a shy, wary ten-year-old in a seemingly placid neighbourhood of Washington, D.C., in the politically charged 1980s. Her mother is agoraphobic and obsessed with the possibility of nuclear war: her father has abandoned the family to return to his native England. Sarah's prospects brighten, however, when she is befriended by Jenny Jones, who moves into the house across the street with her picture-perfect family. With Cold War rhetoric reaching a fever pitch in 1982, the girls distract themselves on a rainy afternoon by writing letters to Soviet premier Yuri Andropv, asking for peace. Surprisingly, Jenny's letter receives a response from Andropov. When Jenny accepts the Kremlin's initiation to visit the USSR with her family, she becomes an international media sensation while Sarah is left behind. The girls' icy relationship still has not thawed when Jenny and her parents die tragically in a plane crash in 1985. Ten years later, Sarah is about to graduate from college when she receives a mysterious letter from a woman in Moscow, suggesting that Jenny's death may have been a hoax. She sets off to the former Soviet Union to uncover the truth, but the more she delves into her personal Cold War history, the harder it is to separate facts from propaganda.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Life should have been easier for Sonea, now that Regin ignored her and the rest of the novices treated her with wary respect, but she cannot forget what she witnessed in Akkarin's underground room, or his warning that Kyralia's ancient enemy is watching the Guild closely. The last few years have been good for Cery. He has a respected position among the Thieves, and connections in high and low places. When an exotic stranger offers to help him with a secret task, Cery knows he should refuse, but life would be boring without the occasional risk... As Akkarin reveals more, Sonea does not know what to believe or what she fears most - that the truth is as terrifying as he claims or that he is trying to make her his accomplice in black magic.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The year is 1975 and Reno--so-called because of the place of her birth--has come to New York intent on turning her fascination with motorcycles and speed into art. Her arrival coincides with an explosion of activity in the art world--artists have colonized a deserted and industrial SoHo, are staging actions in the East Village, and are blurring the line between life and art. Reno meets a group of dreamers and raconteurs who submit her to a sentimental education of sorts. Ardent, vulnerable, and bold, she begins an affair with an artist named Sandro Valera, the semi-estranged scion of an Italian tire and motorcycle empire. When they visit Sandro's family home in Italy, Reno falls in with members of the radical movement that overtook Italy in the seventies. Betrayal sends her reeling into a clandestine undertow.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Be Careful What You Wish For opens with Harry Clifton and his wife Emma rushing to hospital to learn the fate of their son Sebastian, who has been involved in a fatal car accident. But who died, Sebastian or his best friend Bruno? When Ross Buchanan is forced to resign as chairman of the Barrington Shipping Company, Emma Clifton wants to replace him. But Don Pedro Martinez intends to install his puppet, the devious Major Alex Fisher, in order to destroy the Barrington family firm just as the company plans to build its new luxury liner, the MV Buckingham. Back in London, Harry and Emma's adopted daughter wins a scholarship to the Slade Academy of Art where she falls in love with a fellow student, Clive Bingham, who asks her to marry him. Both families are delighted until Priscilla Bingham, Jessica's future mother-in-law, has a visit from an old friend, Lady Virginia Fenwick, who drops her particular brand of poison into the wedding chalice. Then, without warning, Cedric Hardcastle, a bluff Yorkshireman who no one has come across before, takes his place on the board of Barringtons. This causes an upheaval that none of them could have anticipated, and will change the lives of every member of the Clifton and Barrington families. Hardcastle's first decision is who to support to become the next chairman of the board: Emma Clifton or Major Alex Fisher? And with that decision, the story takes yet another twist that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</dc:description>

<dc:description>No-one thought she had the courage...Those looking in from the outside think Lucy Lovejoy's life is like any other, but at the centre of her family there is a big empty hole where all the love and warmth should be. Over the years, her children have watched while their father chipped away at Lucy's self-confidence. Now the children are following their own paths, and Lucy has never felt more alone. When tragedy strikes at the heart of the family, it's a wake-up call for Lucy. Everyone has taken a little piece of her, and she isn't sure who she is anymore. So when Lucy faces a betrayal from those she loves deepest, she knows that it's time to make a choice. Is she brave enough to find herself again?</dc:description>

When a Thames pleasure boat is blown up with the loss of many lives, an Egyptian man is quickly sentenced to hang for the crime. But William Monk, head of the River Police, discovers the evidence was flawed. As he and his wife Hester investigate further, Monk begins to wonder if the wrong man was convicted. If justice itself has been tainted, exposing the true culprit will be far more hazardous...</dc:description>

Some secrets keep you safe, others will destroy you...Detective Inspector Marnie Rome. Dependable; fierce; brilliant at her job; a rising star in the ranks. Everyone knows how Marnie fought to come back from the murder of her parents, but very few know what is going on below the surface. Because Marnie has secrets she won't share with anyone. But then so does everyone. Certainly those in the women's shelter Marnie and Detective Sergeant Noah Jake visit on that fateful day. The day when they arrive to interview a resident, only to find one of the women's husbands, who shouldn't have been there, lying stabbed on the floor. As Marnie and Noah investigate the crime further, events begin to spiral and the violence escalates. Everyone is keeping secrets, some for survival and some, they suspect, to disguise who they really are under their skin. Now, if Marnie is going to find the truth she will have to face her own demons head on. Because the time has come for secrets to be revealed...</dc:description>

<dc:description>From Charlaine Harris, the bestselling author who created Sookie Stackhouse the world of Bon Temps, Louisiana, comes a new, darker world - populated by more strangers than friends. But then, that's how the locals prefer it? Welcome to Midnight, Texas, a town with many boarded-up windows and few full-time inhabitants, located at the crossing of Witch Light Road and Davy Road. It's a pretty standard dried-up western town. There's a pawnshop (someone lives in the basement and is seen only at night). There's a diner (people who are just passing through tend not to linger). And there's new resident Manfred Bernardo, who thinks he's found the perfect place to work in private (and who has secrets of his own). Stop at the one traffic light in town, and everything looks normal. Stay awhile, and learn the truth ...</dc:description>

<dc:description>In 1942, after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, a squadron composed entirely of Russian women fighter pilots was formed. Most were no older than twenty and, because they were women, were given obsolete planes to fly. However, under the skilful command of record-breaking aviatrix Marina Raskova, the squadron soon became one of the most feared in the history of the Second World War. The women would fly to a certain distance within the enemy encampments, cut their engines and then glide silently over their targets. Such missions took nerves of steel. The Germans were so terrified of these women that they called them ‘Nachthexen,’ Nightwitches. his is the story of Katya Makarova, downed from France and in danger of capture by German soldiers. Saved by a Frenchman, the two lovers try to find each other again after the war through a maze of Soviet red tape, lies and deception.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A debut collection of short stories that peel away the private struggles of adolescence, marriage and middle age, with a unique Kuwaiti-American perspective. A young girl, renamed Amerika in honour of the US role in the liberation of Kuwait, finds her name has become a barometer of her country's growing hostility towards the West. A self-conscious Palestinian teenager is drawn into a botched suicide bombing by two belligerent classmates. A middle-aged man dying from cancer looks back on his extramarital affairs and the abiding forgiveness of his wife. A Kuwaiti woman returns to her family after being held captive in Iraq for a decade. The headlines tell of war, unrest and religious clashes. But if you look beyond them you may see life in the Middle East as it is really lived - adolescent love, yearnings for independence, the fragility of marriage, pain of the most quotidian kind. Mai Al-Nakib's luminous stories carefully unveil the lives of ordinary people in the Middle East - and the power of ordinary objects to hold extraordinary memories.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Suddenly a dark blur dropped through her line of vision, followed by a thump behind the glass. Kat saw first the faces of the extras. Then Peru, the prettiest contestant, fixed in horror and disbelief. There was a high, thin, sustained scream. Finally Kat shifted her gaze to the street, where a body lay at all angles in an extravagant splatter of blood. ‘Oh dear,’ she said. Then started, helplessly, laughing. Kat Kelly reckons she's got life sorted. She has a man who cooks and does the dishes. A stepdaughter she adores. And her dream job: scouting locations for a TV production company. All the big dramas are behind her, right? Before she knows it, Kat is out of love and has nowhere to live. Between her ditzy new intern and an amorous ex-footballer, work isn't much better. And just when things couldn't get any worse, disaster strikes Kat's set, sending her spinning totally out of control. Kat Jumps the Shark is a moving and at times hilarious tale about losing it all, only to find it again in the most unexpected place. Full of cheeky digs at television and celebrity culture, this fun-filled novel is for all readers.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Daphne is finally living her American Dream. . . too bad she's been sleepwalking through life. The daughter of Greek immigrants, she's felt trapped between old traditions and the never-ending work of building a new life in New York City. And she's never felt like she quite fits in in either world. But summers with her grandmother on Erikousa, a magical island off the coast of Greece, are her happiest memories. Together she and her Yia-yia cooked, laughed, and talked, her grandmother sharing the ancient myths that give shape to their culture. Yia-yia could always see deep into Daphne's heart, even from afar during their winters apart or the recent, difficult years that kept Daphne from returning to Erikousa. Daphne's young husband died in a car accident, leaving her with an inconsolable baby and stacks of bills. She immersed herself in work to push aside her grief, eventually stepping out from the shadow of her family's diner to open her own Greek restaurant. She's now an acclaimed chef about to marry her wealthy and powerful fiancâe. It's her dream come true, except something is terribly wrong. Only Daphne doesn't know it yet. One person can see through the storybook perfection of Daphne's new life-the one person who, despite the miles between them, can always read Daphne's deepest thoughts and hear her secret, silent prayers. That one person is Daphne's beloved Yia-yia, and she can hear her Yia-yia calling to her to return to Erikousa. When Daphne and her young daughter, Evie, arrive in Erikousa ahead of Daphne's wedding, nothing is the way she wants it to be. Her grandmother is old and frail, and, Daphne fears, losing hold of reality. But Yia-yia has plans of her own. She has brought Daphne home to help her granddaughter one last time: to teach her that she is meant for greater things, that security is not the same as love, that her life can be filled with meaning again. On a lush Greek island, myths, magic, and a colorful cast of mortals come together to call Daphne home. Will Daphne truly learn the lessons her Yia-yia is trying desperately to teach her? And will she come to understand the history of her grandmother's life on the island, and the bravery and loyalty she showed while under siege during World War II WHEN THE CYPRESS WHISPERS is a beautiful debut novel about love and family, set against the gorgeous island landscape of Erikousa.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Internationally renowned thief and con artist Nicolas Fox is famous for running elaborate and daring scams. His greatest con of all: convincing the FBI to team him up with the only person who has ever caught him, Special Agent Kate O'Hare. Together they'll go undercover to swindle and catch the world's most wanted - and untouchable - criminals. Their newest target is Carter Grove, a former White House chief of staff and the ruthless leader of a private security agency. Grove has stolen a rare Chinese artefact from the Smithsonian, a crime that will torpedo U.S. relations with China if it ever becomes public. Nick and Kate must work under the radar - and against the clock - to devise a plan to steal the piece back. Confronting Grove's elite assassins, Nick and Kate rely on the skills of their ragtag crew, including a flamboyant actor, a Geek Squad techie, and a band of AARP-card-carrying mercenaries led by none other than Kate's dad. A daring heist and a deadly chase lead Nick and Kate from Washington, D.C., to Shanghai, from the highlands of Scotland to the underbelly of Montreal. But it'll take more than death threats, trained henchmen, sleepless nights, and the fate of a dynasty's priceless heirloom to outsmart Fox and O'Hare.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Susie Moran is a success. She has founded and run her own highly profitable company, and now her three daughters are all involved in the business. Rooted in the traditions of the Stoke-on-Trent potteries, and producing charming, useable objects of distinctive design, Susie is justly proud of her family and her achievement - and has no intention of letting it change. But what of the men in the family? Susie's husband, a musician and artist, has always seemed happy to take a back seat. One of her sons-in-law has few ambitions outside the home. Another daughter, though, has brought her husband into the company - and they want to change things, much to Susie's distress. And then, into the mix arrives Susie's father, an ageing hippy who abandoned Susie as a baby. Now he's alone, and wants to build bridges, although Susie's daughters are outraged at the idea. Can the needs of a family business override the needs of the family itself? In wanting to preserve her business, will Susie lose something much more precious?</dc:description>
