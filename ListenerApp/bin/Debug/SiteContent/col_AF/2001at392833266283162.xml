<dc:description>A set of anonymous postcards leads Detective Chief Inspector Hennessey to make a chilling discovery. When four postcards are sent anonymously to an advice centre, each with the word 'murder' scribbled in a foreign language and the same precise OS map reference, DCI Hennessey and his team visit the sinister location and make a chilling discovery: the body of a professional man who had been reported missing ten years earlier. Who sent the postcards, and why so long after the crime? As Hennessey and his team investigate they find themselves drawn into a puzzling and dangerous investigation.</dc:description>

<dc:description>For thirty-four years Fabrizio Collini has worked diligently for Mercedes Benz. He is a quiet and respectable person until the day he visits one of Berlin's most luxurious hotels and kills an innocent man. Young attorney Caspar Leinen takes the case. Getting Collini a not-guilty verdict would make his name. But too late he discovers that Collini's victim - an industrialist of some renown - is known to him. Now Leinen is caught in a professional and personal dilemma. Collini admits the murder but won't say why he did it, forcing Leinen to defend a man who won't put up a defence. And worse, a close friend and relation of the victim insists that he give up the case. His reputation, his career and this friendship are all at risk. Then he makes a discovery that goes way beyond his own petty concerns and exposes a terrible and deadly truth at the heart of German justice...</dc:description>

<dc:publisher>New York : W.W. Norton &amp; Co.,</dc:publisher>
<dc:date>c2011.</dc:date>
<dc:language>eng</dc:language>
<dc:description>In his most irreverent novel yet, Ryu Murakami creates a rivalry of epic proportions between six aimless youths and six tough-as-nails women who battle for control of a Tokyo neighborhood. At the outset, the young men seem louche but harmless, their activities limited to drinking, snacking, peering at a naked neighbor through a window, and performing karaoke. The six "aunties" are fiercely independent career women. When one of the boys executes a lethal ambush of one of the women, chaos ensues. The women band together to find the killer and exact revenge. In turn, the boys buckle down, study physics, and plot to take out their nemeses in a single blast. Who knew that a deadly "gang war" could be such fun? Murakami builds the conflict into a hilarious, spot-on satire of modern culture and the tensions between the sexes and generations.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Haya Tedeschi sits alone in Gorizia, north-eastern Italy, surrounded by a basket of photographs and newspaper clippings. Now an old woman, she waits to be reunited after sixty-two years with her son, fathered by an S.S. officer and stolen from her by the German authorities during the War as part of Himmler's clandestine 'Lebensborn' project, which strove for a 'racially pure' Germany. Haya's reflection on her Catholicized Jewish family's experiences deals unsparingly with the massacre of Italian Jews in the concentration camps of Trieste. Her obsessive search for her son leads her to photographs, maps and fragments of verse, to testimonies from the Nuremberg trials and interviews with second-generation Jews, as well as witness accounts of atrocities that took place on her doorstep. A broad collage of material is assembled, and the lesser-known horror of Nazi occupation in northern Italy is gradually unveiled. Written in immensely powerful language, and employing a range of astonishing conceptual devices, Trieste is a novel like no other. Dasa Drndic has produced a shattering contribution to the literature of our twentieth-century history.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The second book in the brand new trilogy from the author of the Tawny Man trilogy, following on from the bestselling Shaman's Crossing. The King's Cavalla Academy has been ravaged by the Speck plague. The disease has decimated the ranks of both cadets and instructors, and even the survivors remain sickly. Many have been forced to relinquish their military ambitions and return to their families to face lives of dependency and disappointment. As the Academy infirmary empties, Cadet Nevare Burvelle also prepares to journey home, to attend his brother Rosse's wedding. Far from being a broken man, Nevare is hale and hearty after his convalescence. He has defeated his nemesis, Tree Woman and freed himself of the Speck magic that infected him and attempted to turn him against his own people. A bright future awaits him as a commissioned officer betrothed to a beautiful young noblewoman. Yet his nights are still haunted by dreams of the voluptuous Tree Woman, dreams in which his Speck self betrays everything he holds dear in his waking life. Has the plague infected him in ways far more mysterious than the merely physical? Despite his fears, Nevare will journey back to Widevale in high spirits, in full expectation of a jubilant homecoming and a tender reunion with his beautiful fiancee, Carsina. But his life is about to take a shocking turn, as the magic in his blood roars to life and forces him to recognize that his most dangerous enemy, an enemy that seeks to destroy all he loves, might dwell within him.</dc:description>

<dc:creator>Brooks, Geraldine,author.</dc:creator>
<dc:type>text</dc:type>
<dc:type>Historical fiction.</dc:type>
<dc:language>eng</dc:language>
<dc:description>Winner of the 2006 Pulitzer Prize For Fiction. From the author of the acclaimed YEAR OF WONDERS, an historical novel and love story set during a time of catastrophe, on the front lines of the American Civil War. Acclaimed author Geraldine Brooks gives us the story of the absent father from Louisa May Alcott's Little Women - and conjures a world of brutality, stubborn courage and transcendent love. An idealistic abolitionist, March has gone as chaplain to serve the Union cause. But the war tests his faith not only in the Union - which is also capable of barbarism and racism - but in himself. As he recovers from a near-fatal illness, March must reassemble and reconnect with his family, who have no idea of what he has endured. A love story set in a time of catastrophe, March explores the passions between a man and a woman, the tenderness of parent and child, and the life-changing power of an ardently held belief. </dc:description>

<dc:description>Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin tales are widely acknowledged to be the greatest series of historical novels ever written. Patrick O'Brian is regarded by many as the greatest historical novelist now writing. Post Captain, the second novel in his remarkable Aubrey/Maturin series, led Mary Renault to write: 'Master and Commander raised dangerously high expectations; Post Captain triumphantly surpasses them.' This tale begins with Jack Aubrey arriving home from his exploits in the Mediterranean to find England at peace following the Treaty of Amiens. He and his friend Stephen Maturin, surgeon and secret agent, begin to live the lives of country gentlemen, hunting, entertaining and enjoying more amorous adventures. Their comfortable existence, however, is cut short when Jack is overnight reduced to a pauper with enough debts to keep him in prison for life. He flees to the continent to seek refuge: instead he finds himself a hunted fugitive as Napoleon has ordered the internment of all Englishmen in France. Aubrey's adventures in escaping from France and the debtors' prison will grip the reader as fast as his unequalled actions at sea.</dc:description>

<dc:description>It's February, and Carnival time in Venice. Bright blue skies and freezing temperatures welcome Teresa Lupo, forensic pathologist to the Rome Questura, to the city. She is greeted off the vaporetto by an anonymous masked man dressed as The Plague Doctor. Teresa has taken time out from her job to find her beloved bohemian aunt Sofia who has mysteriously disappeared. There seem to be no clues as to her whereabouts, but a visit to Sofia's very strange apartment in the Dorsoduro confirms Teresa's suspicions that all is not well. The puzzle deepens when a letter reveals a piece of fiction in which both Sofia and Teresa appear. Even more strange, are the links to Venetian culture which gradually begin to surface. Are the messages being sent by Sofia herself? Her abductor? Or a third party seeking to help her unravel the mystery? The revelation when it comes is as surprising and shocking as Sofia's fate. And Teresa herself comes to depend upon the unravelling of a mystery wrapped deep inside the art and culture of Venice itself.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Bernie, a divorced mother of three, lives in a converted shed - albeit with a great view - in Byron Bay. She works part-time as a journalist for the local paper. Bernie has an amicable relationship with her ex-husband and strong female friendships. Her life is steady, normal, and recognisable. While writing her first novel, she gets in contact with an old friend from university. Jack is married, has two children, and has never forgotten Bernie. A tortuous, intimate, passionate - yet frustratingly sexless - affair follows, fuelled by the exchange of hundreds of confessional text messages and emails. Jack's inability to be physically available to support Bernie becomes clear when her father dies and she is threatened by her neighbour. When Jack ends their relationship, Bernie is emotionally destroyed and wracked with guilt. She seeks solace in a string of increasingly dangerous and twisted sexual encounters. What begins as an innocent search for validation on internet dating sites leads - frighteningly quickly - to sexting, pornography, brief liaisons in seedy motels, group sex, and swingers' parties. She hides her new lifestyle from her family and friends and retreats into nameless, addictive sex.</dc:description>

At 34, Faith Roberts isn't so different from most women her age. Okay, so her cleavage is rather disappointing and she's still single, but she has a busy job, the usual dysfunctional family, and clinically depressed best friend. Practically normal then? Faith used to think about falling in love, but that was a long time ago. As a counsellor in a women's crisis centre, she's heard one too many love-gone-wrong stories so it's hard for her not to give up on the big things, like love, hope and trust - let alone the chance of getting a decent haircut or meeting a halfway normal bloke. Then one night, a twist of fate finds Faith in a situation that transforms her life, bringing her to finally understand what she has always needed to know: that before you can save others, you have to save yourself.</dc:description>

<dc:title>The annotated Lolita /</dc:title>

<dc:description>When 'Lolita' was first published in 1955 it created a sensation and established Nabokov as one of the most original prose writers of the twentieth century. This annotated edition, a revised and considerably expanded version of the 1970 edition, does full justice to the textual riches of 'Lolita', illuminating the elaborate verbal textures and showing how they contribute to the novel's overall meaning. Alfred Appel, Jr. also provides fresh observations on the novel's artifice, games and verbal patternings and a delightful biographical vignette of Nabokov. The annotations themselves were prepared in consultation with Nabokov while newly identified allusions were confirmed by him during the final years of his life.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Gost is surrounded by mountains and fields of wild flowers. The summer sun burns. The Croatian winter brings freezing winds. Beyond the boundaries of the town an old house which has lain empty for years is showing signs of life. One of the windows, glass darkened with dirt, today stands open, and the lively chatter of English voices carries across the fallow fields. Laura and her teenage children have arrived. A short distance away lies the hut of Duro Kolak who lives alone with his two hunting dogs. As he helps Laura with repairs to the old house, they uncover a mosaic beneath the ruined plaster and, in the rising heat of summer, painstakingly restore it. But Gost is not all it seems; conflicts long past still suppurate beneath the scars.</dc:description>

Meanwhile, the pathogen spreads. The government is forced to quarantine sections of the city. Fences go up, and soldiers in bio-hazard suits take to the streets. Gangs take over day-to-day law and order in the sectioned off hot zones and society generally begins to unravel.

As intelligencer to the Lord Chamberlain, Thomas Chaloner cannot understand why a man of known incompetence is put in charge of investigating the attack while he is diverted to make enquiries about the poisoning of birds in the King's aviary in St James's Park. He becomes even more suspicious of his employer's motives when he discovers that the witnesses he needs to interview have close links to the business conducted in the General Letter Office, activities more firmly centred on intercepting people's mail than delivering it. Then human rather than avian victims are poisoned, and Chaloner knows he has to ignore his master's instructions and use his own considerable wits to defeat an enemy whose deadly tentacles reach into the very heart of the government: an enemy who has the power and expertise to destroy anyone who stands in the way ...</dc:description>

<dc:description>Human Remains, the latest novel from crime-writing sensation Elizabeth Haynes, is a powerful and chilling thriller that preys on our darkest fears, showing how vulnerable we are when we live alone, and how easily ordinary lives can fall apart when no one is watching. How well do you know your neighbour? How well do they know you? Would they notice if you lived or died? Police Analyst Annabel wouldn't describe herself as lonely. Her work keeps her busy and the needs of her ageing mother and her cat are more than enough to fill her time. But when Annabel discovers her neighbours decomposing body in the house next door, she is appalled to think that no one, including herself, noticed her absence. Back at work, she is compelled to investigate, despite her colleagues' lack of interest, and finds data showing that such cases are frighteningly common in her home town. People, of all ages, all dying of natural causes. Seemingly. All forgotten. But for Annabel. As Annabel is drawn deeper into the mystery, she comes face to face with her own demons and her own mortality. Would anyone notice if she just disappeared?</dc:description>

<dc:description>When Jack Haines reports a break-in at his greenhouse, the motive of the intruder is unclear. Other than the destruction of some expensive orchids, no damage has been done and nothing seems to be missing. But Detectives Sloan and Crosby sense something sinister, and soon their suspicions are confirmed. Similar reports are multiplying and sabotage is the word on everyone's lips. The pair are drawn into an equally perplexing case when the mysterious Miss Enid Maude Osgathorp goes missing. Investigations begin at her deserted abode, Canonry Cottage, where the detectives soon discover that the house has been raided. Shattered glass is found in the larder and traces of blood bespatter the floor, a disturbing event has taken place, but the identity of the perpetrator is unknown. It soon becomes clear that the cases are linked, but will this provide the clues necessary to solve the mystery? Detectives Sloan and Crosby aim to find out.</dc:description>

<dc:description>On-board the MV Helios, cruising around the Mediterranean, copywriter David Ansell is seeking inspiration to write a glowing account of his voyage for the ship's owner, Rex Cruising Company. His inspiration comes in the form of the blonde and beautiful Melanie Caine and they are inseparable for the rest of the cruise. Back home in suburbia with his wife, Ansell is pining for Melanie, so is delighted to get a call from her summoning him to meet her, along with the toy monkey she asked him to take through customs for her. When she doesn't turn up, he assumes she's got cold feet and no longer wants to pursue their relationship. However, when reports of a woman's body being found, horrifically tortured, are aired on the news, and Ansell's home is broken into with tragic consequences, it seems there's something that Ansell may have that someone will do anything to find.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Cecilia Ross is a motivational speaker who encourages others to change their lives for the better. Why can't she take her own advice? Still reeling from the death of her best friend, and freshly aware of the need to live more fully now, Cece realizes that she has to make a move - all the portentous signs seem to point in that direction. She downsizes her life, sells her suburban Minnesota home and lets go of many of her possessions. She moves into a beautiful old house in Saint Paul, complete with a garden, chef's kitchen, and three housemates: Lise, the home's owner and a divorced mother at odds with her twenty-year-old daughter; Joni, a top-notch sous chef at a first-rate restaurant with a grade A jerk of a boss; and Renie, the youngest and most mercurial of the group, who is trying to rectify a teenage mistake. These women embark on a journey together in an attempt to connect with parts of themselves long denied. For Cece, that means finding Dennis Halsinger. Despite being "the one who got away," Dennis has never been far from Cece's thoughts. Required to complete a celebrity biography on her own after the suspicious death of her charismatic partner, agoraphobic ghost writer Em Moore struggles through the job's required interviews with alluring film director Garrett Malcolm, who alludes to dark family secrets and trouble with a fellow star.</dc:description>

But rehearsals are fraught. Ophelia is played by Katrina Selsey, who won the role through a television talent show. Hamlet himself is also played by a reality TV contestant, Jared Root - and the two young stars have rather different views of celebrity and the theatre than the more experienced members of the cast. But when the company reach the first staging post of their tour, the Grand Theatre Marlborough, matters get more serious, with one member of the company seriously injured in what appears to be an accident, and another dead. Once again, Charles Paris is forced to don the mantle of amateur detective to get to the bottom of the mystery.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Here on Earth, Danny North is still in high school, yet he holds in his heart and mind all the stolen outselves of thirteen centuries of gatemages. The Families still want to kill him if they can't control him, and they can't control him. He is far too powerful. And on Westil, Wad is now nearly powerless, he lost everything to Danny in their struggle. Even if he can survive the revenge of his enemies, he still must somehow make peace with the Gatemage Daniel North. For when Danny took that power from Loki, he also took the responsibility for the Great Gates. And when he comes face-to-face with the mages who call themselves Bel and Ishtoreth, he will come to understand just why Loki closed the gates all those centuries ago.</dc:description>

<dc:title>Blood and beauty /</dc:title>
<dc:creator>Dunant, Sarah.</dc:creator>

<dc:type>Historical fiction.</dc:type>
<dc:publisher>London : Virago,</dc:publisher>
<dc:date>2013.</dc:date>
<dc:language>eng</dc:language>
<dc:description>Acclaimed novelist of the Italian Renaissance Sarah Dunant now takes on the era's most infamous family: the Borgias. By the end of the fifteenth century, the beauty and creativity of Italy is matched by its brutality and corruption, nowhere more than in Rome and in the Church. When Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia buys his way into the papacy as Alexander VI, he is defined not just by his wealth or his passionate love for his illegitimate children, but by his blood: he is a Spanish Pope in a city run by Italians. If the Borgias are to triumph, this charismatic, consummate politician with a huge appetite for life, women and power must use papacy and family to succeed. His eldest son Cesare, a dazzlingly cold intelligence and an even colder soul, is his greatest - though increasingly unstable - weapon. Later immortalised in Machiavelli's The Prince, he provides the energy and the muscle. His daughter Lucrezia, beloved by both men, is the prime dynastic tool. Twelve years old when the novel opens, hers is a journey through three marriages: from childish innocence to painful experience, from pawn to political player. Stripping away the myths around the Borgias, Blood &amp; Beauty is a majestic novel that breathes life into this astonishing family and celebrates the raw power of history itself: compelling, complex and relentless.</dc:description>

<dc:description>A devastating tragedy still looms over Adam's family years later - can he find the answers to unresolved questions? What happened in the Lake District twenty-six years ago that resulted in a family being torn apart? An old tragedy, still unresolved, brings together estranged brother and sister Adam and Kirsty, who try to solve it despite their relatives' objections. Does a missing camera hold clues to what might have happened? Meanwhile Kirsty, co-owner of a cake-making company, has more immediate worries in the form of increasingly threatening emails and gifts, all sent anonymously. Someone is watching her - someone who knows where she lives. Is it an obsessed stranger, or one of her circle of friends? Is there anyone she can trust?</dc:description>

<dc:description>Jimmy thinks he knows about loss, about fear, about paranoia. He should think again. Every time Jimmy Thane has been faced with a crossroad, he's taken the wrong path. But after years of drinking and womanising, he has been given one last chance to save both his career and his marriage - he has seven weeks to transform a failing company. From the moment he enters the building there's something wrong - the place is too quiet, too empty. When the police come calling about the disappearance of the former CEO, Jimmy starts to wonder what he's got himself into. Then he discovers surveillance equipment in his neighbour's house, looking straight into his front room. And his wife isn't just tired, she's terrified and trying to hide it. Nothing is at it seems. Jimmy's not living his dream - he's been plunged into the worst kind of nightmare. And when the truth comes out, it's more terrifying than he could ever imagine...</dc:description>

Henry could have said no - but if there's one thing he can't refuse, it's the chance to bring a murderer to book. In his thirty years with the Lancashire constabulary, Henry Christie has never known a case like this. What he couldn't anticipate was that he would be stretched to the limit both personally and professionally. Unexpectedly stepping into a blood-soaked turf war raging between two local crime families, Henry soon finds himself slap-bang in the middle of a violent situation where his own life is also on the line.</dc:description>

What business can this confident, yet secretive, young woman have at Tudor Lodge, the beautiful old home of Brussels-based lawyer Andrew Penhallow, where she asks to be dropped? Penhallow is constantly toing and froing from the Continent, but that night, unusually, he is at home, and, with his son away and his wife Carla in bed with a migraine, alone. Which is unfortunate, for the next morning he is found murdered in the garden. To the vicarious delight of the locals, who are quick to recall old disputes, Penhallow's death results in some spectacular revelations about his double life, developments which make the murder investigation all the more delicate for Superintendent Markby, who knew the dead man as a young body. Andrew Penhallow certainly had ghosts in his past, has one come back to claim him?</dc:description>

<dc:description>"Some people have dreams that are so magnificent that if they were to achieve them, their place in history would be guaranteed. Francis Drake, Robert Scott, Charles Lindbergh, Amy Johnson, Edmund Hillary, Neil Armstrong, and Lewis and Clark are among such individuals. But what if one man had such a dream, and once he'd fulfilled it, there was no proof that he had achieved his ambition?" "Paths of Glory is the story of such a man - George Mallory. Mallory once told an American reporter that he wanted to climb Mt. Everest, "because it is there." On his third attempt in 1924, at age thirty-seven, he was last seen six hundred feet from the top. His body was found in 1999, and it still remains a mystery whether he ever reached the summit." "But only after you've turned the last page of this novel, inspired by a true story, will you be able to decide if George Mallory's name should be added to the list of legends, in which case another name would have to be removed."--BOOK JACKET.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Child of the revolution, maiden of myth, bride of darkness. A handsome young man arrives in St Petersburg at the house of Marya Morevna. He is Koschei, the Tsar of Life, and he is Marya's fate. Koschei leads Marya to his kingdom, where she becomes a warrior in his tireless battle against his own brother, the Tsar of Death. Years pass. Battle-hardened, scarred by love, and longing for respite, Marya returns to St Petersburg only to discover a place as pitiful as the land she has just fled: a starveling city, haunted by death. "Deathless" is a fierce story of life and death, love and power, old memories, deep myth and dark magic, set against the history of Russia in the twentieth century. It is, quite simply, unforgettable.</dc:description>

<dc:description>David is a small boy who has come by boat across the ocean to a new country. He has been separated from his parents, and has lost the piece of paper that would have explained everything. On the boat a Man named Simon has taken it upon himself to look after the boy. On arrival they have been assigned new names, new birthdays. They know nothing about the customs of their new country. They know little Spanish, the language spoken there. They are people without a past. Simon wants to find the boy's mother. He feels sure he will know her when he sees her. 'But after we find her' David asks, 'what are we here for?'</dc:description>

<dc:description>"Young Carmen Dula and her family are about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime - they're going to Mars. Being picked from the lottery is considered an opportunity not to missed, even though Carmen isn't so sure she wants to bother with it anymore. After training for a year and preparing to leave on the six-month journey through space, she finds that the initial excitement has given way to nervous trepidation - and frustration." "Once on the Red Planet, however, Carmen realizes things are not so different from Earth. There are chores to do, lessons to learn, and oppressive authority figures to rebel against. Which leads her to venture out into the bleak Mars landscape alone one night, where a simple accident takes her to the edge of death - and she is saved by an angel." "An angel with too many arms and legs, a head that looks like a potato gone bad - and a message for the newly arrived human inhabitants of Mars: We were here first."--BOOK JACKET.</dc:description>

<dc:description>We are Not the Same Anymore is a collection of short fiction about people trying to connect with each other and the difficulties of finding intimacy. In these stories, Chris Somerville plays out the small catastrophes of everyday life, cutting his characters adrift in the uneasiness that ensues. A man turns up at his daughter's birthday party with a goldfish in an ice-cream container. On the way to collect firewood, a woman and her teenaged neighbour crash in a snowstorm. An unwilling son helps his sister and father put up posters for a missing dog named Michael. Familiar and endearing, Somerville's characters are consumed with their own neuroses, and through their eyes, the landscape of the domestic becomes surreal and dully terrifying. Suffused with a dark humour, their struggles for intimacy are recreated on the page with a deft and affectionate touch.</dc:description>

<dc:description>Grief, loss and guilt are enormous burdens for a whole family to carry. A tern will fly to the moon, to live its life in summer...I suppose I'd like to have a little bit of that. It's boom time in sixteen-year-old Kenno's coastal holiday town. Tourists are buying and building and developing property, and easy money seems to be everywhere. Even birds flock there to nest on the sand and on the cliffs, out to the islands. But for those who live in the holiday town all year round, there is bleakness too, and Kenno's family, haunted by a terrible loss, struggle to get by. When the family is evicted from their home, Kenno figures they're entitled to a little easy money of their own, and that it's his job to make things right. Believing it could go a long way to healing them in all their separate ways. Kenno finds a beautiful house and forms a plan to get the money for it. But the closer he gets to the money, the more complicated things become, and when he involves his sister in his plan, who likes to test the world and goes looking for danger, things move quickly beyond his control.</dc:description>

<dc:description>The puppet boy of Warsaw is the story of Mika, a Jewish boy who inherits a coat from his grandfather and discovers a puppet in one of its many secret pockets. He becomes a puppeteer in the Warsaw ghetto, but when his talent is discovered, Mika is forced to entertain the occupying German troops instead of his countrymen. It is also the story of Max, a German soldier stationed in Warsaw, whose experiences in Poland and later in Siberia's Gulag show a different side to the Second World War. As one of Mika's puppets is passed to the soldier, a war-torn legacy is handed from one generation to another. Gripping and heartbreaking in equal measure, a story of courage and redemption that will appeal to anyone who enjoyed The book thief or The boy in the striped pyjamas, and marks the arrival of an important new talent.</dc:description>

<dc:description>"I wish I could tell everyone who thinks we're ruined, Look closer...and you'll see something extraordinary, mystifying, something real and true. We have never been what we seemed." When beautiful, reckless Southern belle Zelda Sayre meets F. Scott Fitzgerald at a country club dance in 1918, she is seventeen years old and he is a young army lieutenant stationed in Alabama. Before long, the "ungettable" Zelda has fallen for him despite his unsuitability, Scott isn't wealthy or prominent or even a Southerner, and keeps insisting, absurdly, that his writing will bring him both fortune and fame. Her father is deeply unimpressed. But after Scott sells his first novel, "This Side of Paradise," to Scribner's, Zelda optimistically boards a train north, to marry him in the vestry of St. Patrick's Cathedral and take the rest as it comes.</dc:description>
